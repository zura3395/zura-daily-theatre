What should I prioritize?"},{"n":"18","d":"Wow...... you do have a lot of things you want to do. Develop new running courses, brainstorm concert ideas, hold an Ai Pals fan meeting, put on a punny show, make new costumes, and come up with a new monjayaki menu item......."},{"n":"22","d":"Ayumu, do you ever get stuck on what you should do?"},{"n":"18","d":"Of course I have. I want to create new costume designs, memorize new dance steps, reply to fan mail, and so on. Ai-chan, I want to work on fitness training for my next concert just like you."},{"n":"22","d":"I see...... Ai got it. Getting hung up like this is a waste of time.

Let’s develop new running courses together!"},{"n":"18","d":"Gotcha! Let’s get changed into our training uniforms then!"}]}
