Legend says that a lord was invited to take shelter inside the temple by a beckoning cat when he was caught out during a thunderstorm......"},{"n":"1","d":"I didn’t know there was such a temple."},{"n":"27","d":"The white cat figurines you can get there look like Hanpen, so I wanted to put one in our clubroom as decoration."},{"n":"1","d":"That sounds like a great idea. Maybe I should get one for our clubroom too."},{"n":"27","d":"Yes, by all means! The lucky cats sold here raise their right hands and don’t hold a gold coin, unlike the ones elsewhere. You can get one with a green bandana to invite energy for growth."},{"n":"1","d":"Really? That’s very interesting. Meeting everyone in µ’s helped me grow. Meeting Nijigaku, Aqours, and everyone who cheers me on also helped me grow. It seems like getting one would help me keep growing."},{"n":"27","d":"That’s right. With the power of green, we’ll be able to grow more and more!"}]}
