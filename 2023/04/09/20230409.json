I saw the script, and it’s soooooo interesting! And it even had a cliffhanger ending! So, I want a role too. But I can’t decide if I want to be on the side of the angels or the fallen angels. It’s so tough."},{"n":"14","d":"Huh, really..."},{"n":"0","d":"So, I was wondering if there’s another role we could create other than the angels and fallen angels, and I thought Yohane-chan would know best! You’re the expert, right?"},{"n":"14","d":"The expert...? Well, I guess so! If that’s the case, then asking fallen angel Yohane is your best choice."},{"n":"0","d":"I knew it! Do you have any good ideas?"},{"n":"14","d":"Yohane isn’t really into plays or anything, but if you really want to create a role, I’ll help you. Let’s see... I’ve heard of a place called Purgatory that’s between Heaven and Hell... How about something like that?"},{"n":"0","d":"Whaaaaat!? There’s a middle ground!? That’s amazing! I want to play a character from there! I’m gonna get Shizuku-chan and Umi-chan so we can discuss it!"}]}
