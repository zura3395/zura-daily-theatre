I’d like to experience that too."},{"n":"28","d":"Don’t you kinda live like you’re in a dorm too? I mean, you can talk to Chika on the balcony, right? That’s what she told me."},{"n":"10","d":"Yeah, that’s true. Chika-chan is my next-door neighbor, and our rooms are right next to each other."},{"n":"28","d":"I’m so jealous of that too! We can’t talk on the balcony in the dorms."},{"n":"10","d":"Is that so?"},{"n":"28","d":"Yes! When I’m about to sleep and suddenly have an idea for a live performance, I want someone to hear me out right away. You can do that with Chika, can’t you?"},{"n":"10","d":"Hmm... I guess it’s easier to discuss things like that. Though we do send messages to each other before we go outside to talk."},{"n":"28","d":"Being neighbors is just as great as dorm life, huh! How awesome!"}]}
