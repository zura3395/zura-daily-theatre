It looks great on you! The big frilly lace on the sleeves is light and cute, and the big ribbon at your waist is also cute, but it doesn’t look too cutesy since it’s made from a shiny, stiff material. Your brooch also looks lovely!"},{"n":"14","d":"Really?! I put a lot of thought into it!"},{"n":"2","d":"Wait, Yoshiko... Yohane-chan, did you remember what I said before? That you should wear what suits you. That’s what I said, right?"},{"n":"14","d":"Well, not exactly, but... I mean, I didn’t forget everything.
