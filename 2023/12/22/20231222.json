Did she seem down?"},{"n":"21","d":"Hehe, she was incredibly lively! She even ate all of the sandwiches Emma made for her, including the ones meant for lunch."},{"n":"27","d":"Eh?"},{"n":"21","d":"Shioriko-chan... Lanzhu is exactly as you say, but after a good night’s sleep, she’s back to her usual self. That doesn’t mean she’s forgotten your words. She’s taken them in and made them her own. So don’t worry, just talk to her, and it’ll be okay."},{"n":"27","d":"O-Okay! I will! Thank you so much, Karin-san!"}]}
